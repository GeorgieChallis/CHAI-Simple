The UbiCube framework consists of software to interface between movement sensors/microcontrollers, OpenGL graphics with CHAI3D C++ haptics libraries, VICON motion capture and VR (Oculus Rift) to enable creation of virtual environments that work with different hardware setups. 

To demonstrate this capability, a 3D-printed Arduino peripheral was created to show how real object manipulation maps to the created virtual worlds. This works with any combination of the below with no additional configuration:

* Standard flat screen
* Oculus VR headset
* Touch controllers
* UbiCube custom controller 
* CHAI3D compatible haptic devices
* Vicon tracking software

## Future Improvements
1. Re-factor code into different classes - more OOP approach
2. Unit tests for key functionality
3. Separate out Psych demo from the main framework

Reminder: If using Visual Studio, run in *Release* mode
